SJF = shortest job first
FCFS = first come first serve

SUMMARY:
- Average Wait Time: SJF < FCFS < LJF always
- Maximum Wait Time: FCFS < SJF < LJF mostly
- Finishing Time: FCFS < LJF < SJF

TIME COMPLEXITIES:

> SJF and LJF:
	- First sorts the list of jobs using Collections.sort(), using a modified mergesort taking far less than nlog(n) time
	- SJF() goes through the list of n size n times. However, the list is sorted so it will be significantly less than n^2 time. Also, the size of the list decreases each repeat in the while loop
	
> FCFS: 
	- Collections.sort(): < nlog(n) time
	- only one traversal of the job list: linear time
